# Websockets-Chat-app
A chat room app using socket.io in node js where users can enter through a nickname(handle) and start messaging. The sent messages are emitted to all other users in the chat room. A typing message is also showed to all the other users except the one typing. I gave the app an anime theme just for fun and roleplaying my favourite anime characters.
